> ðŸ’¡ Tips: This bot uses Mongodb as a database, you can set-up your cluster [here](https://www.mongodb.com), otherwise you can change to whatever database you prefer.

## Facebook Page, Facebook App, Facebook Access Token
This bot use Facebook webhook services that requires you to create your own Facebook Page and a PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN that will use to communicate between our server
and Facebook server through a webhook. If you dont have one please create your own first [HERE](https://developers.facebook.com/)

## Deployment 
To deploy a live webhook that can receive webhook events from the Messenger Platform, your code must be hosted on a public HTTPS server that meets the following requirements:
- HTTPS support, Self-signed certificates are not supported
- A valid SSL certificate
- An open port that accepts GET and POST requests

Facebook webhook requires a valid SSL certificates to sent a data to our endpoints, so we need cloud to handle this, at this point you can use whatever service you like,
like AWS, Heroku, or even your own machine. i personally prefer Heroku as a PaaS, learn more about deployment on [Heroku Devcenter](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs)
